Cats
----
- [ ] Depreciated => [Updated Repository with React](https://github.com/akleventis/react_project)

- This project showcases some of the frontend development concepts I've been learning during school. I thought to myself, what better than to make images of cats move on a webpage!? So... that's what this is. Enjoy! Used an XMLHttpRequest to fetch images from the api linked below. Hosted through AWS using Cloudfront for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (https)
